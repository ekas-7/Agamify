Multi Web Framework builder Agent + Function visualizer

## Abstract
This project introduces an intelligent agent designed to migrate web application code across multiple frontend frameworks, streamlining cross-framework development and modernization workflows. The Multi Web Framework Builder Agent + Function Visualizer takes a single-source codebase—originally written in frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or Next.js—and automatically translates it into semantically equivalent implementations in all other supported frameworks. This migration preserves functionality, component structure, and application logic, enabling seamless interoperability and comparative analysis.

Accompanying this migration capability is a powerful Function Visualizer, which performs static analysis on the original and translated code to generate interactive visualizations of function call graphs, component hierarchies, and data flow relationships. This aids in understanding complex logic, debugging discrepancies between framework implementations, and ensuring fidelity across translations.

By combining LLM-based transformation with visual introspection, the system supports use cases ranging from legacy migration and framework benchmarking to educational exploration and rapid prototyping. The platform not only reduces the manual overhead of rewriting applications but also deepens developers’ cross-framework insight through a unified, visual, and explainable interface.
## Story
This idea come to me when really annoyed with a fight with a co-intern over architecture of some tool similar to remote desktop. I was in my intern working on something similar called asserted graphs for code migration so i thought a use case to solve the problem of modern web frame works with better archithecure design.
